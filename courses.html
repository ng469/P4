				<div class=""><h3>What is climate change?</h3><span class="clear spacer_responsive_hide_mobile " style="height:13px;display:block;"></span>Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns are referred to as climate change. These changes could be caused by natural processes, such oscillations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities—primarily the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas—have been the primary cause of climate change. Fossil fuel combustion produces greenhouse gas emissions that serve as a blanket around the planet, trapping heat from the sun and increasing temperatures. Carbon dioxide and methane are two examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change. These are produced, for instance, while burning coal or gasoline to heat a building. Carbon dioxide can also be released during forest and land clearing. Methane emissions are primarily produced by garbage landfills. Some of the main emitters are energy, buildings, agriculture, industry, transportation, and land.</div>

				<div class=""><h3>Causes of climate change:</h3><span class="clear spacer_responsive_hide_mobile " style="height:13px;display:block;"></span>Throughout the history of our world, there has always been climate change. But given that it is a product of human activity, the recent global warming—which has been occurring for around 150 years—is abnormal. The anthropogenic greenhouse effect is a phenomenon that happens in addition to the natural greenhouse effect. With the advent of the industrial revolution, man abruptly started releasing millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, more than tripling the amount of CO2 present there compared to the lowest levels seen in the previous 700,000 years (410-415 parts per million compared with 200-180 parts per million).  </div>

				<div class=""><h3>Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect:</h3><span class="clear spacer_responsive_hide_mobile " style="height:13px;display:block;"></span>The Earth's atmosphere contains gases that trap heat and prevent it from escaping into space. These are the "greenhouse gases." The "greenhouse effect," which is caused by these gases, warms the Earth as a whole.
There are both natural and human-made sources of greenhouse gases. The atmosphere contains gases including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide by nature. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), for example, are solely created by human activity.
Most of the sun's short-wave energy that reaches Earth travels through unimpeded and strikes the surface. The majority of this radiation is absorbed by the Earth, which then emits infrared light with longer wavelengths.
Some of this infrared light is absorbed by the greenhouse gases rather than being sent directly into space. The globe then warms as a result of the radiation that the atmosphere releases in all directions, some of which is reflected back to the surface. The "greenhouse effect" is the term used to describe this phenomenon.
Our survival is dependent on the greenhouse effect. In fact, without greenhouse gases, the Earth would be around 30 degrees colder than it is right now. We couldn't live without greenhouse gases and their warming effect.
However, since the Industrial Revolution, we've been introducing more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping more heat. The greenhouse effect is heating the globe far more quickly than it would otherwise, maintaining it at a warm, steady temperature.

				<div class=""><h3>Human causes: </h3><span class="clear spacer_responsive_hide_mobile " style="height:13px;display:block;"></span>Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere by people, which results in climate change. More carbon dioxide is present in the atmosphere today than at least the previous 2 million years. Carbon dioxide levels increased by 40% between the 20th and 21st centuries.
There are numerous methods in which we generate greenhouse gases like deforestation, burning fossil fuels, agriculture, and cement.

                <h3>Hotter temperatures:</h3>
				<p>The global surface temperature rises together with greenhouse gas concentrations. The warmest decade on record was from 2011 to 2020. Every decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the one before it. There are more hot days and heat waves in almost all land locations. Higher temperatures exacerbate heat-related ailments and make it more challenging to work outside. When the weather is hotter, wildfires start more easily and spread more quickly. The Arctic has warmed at least twice as quickly as the rest of the world.

                  <h3>Rising sea levels:</h3>
				<p>Regarding climate change, there are two primary ways that sea level can rise. First, seawater expands as seas warm as a result of rising global temperatures, taking up more space in the ocean basin and raising the water level. The second mechanism involves the melting of glaciers on land, which results in the ocean receiving more water.

                  <h3>Increased drought:</h3>
				<p>Water supply is changing due to climate change, becoming more scarce in many places. In already water-stressed areas, global warming makes water shortages worse. It also increases the danger of ecological and agricultural droughts, which can harm crops and make ecosystems more vulnerable. Additionally, severe sand and dust storms that can transport billions of tons of sand across continents can be sparked by droughts. As deserts spread, there is less space for agriculture. The threat of regularly not having enough water affects a lot of people nowadays.</p>

                <h3>Loss of species:</h3>
				<p>Both animals on land and in the ocean are at risk from climate change. As the temperatures rise, these risks rise as well. The rate of extinction in the planet is 1,000 times higher now than it has ever been in recorded human history, and this is exacerbated by climate change. Within the next few decades, one million species face extinction. Threats from climate change include exotic pests and illnesses, forest fires, and harsh weather. Others won't be able to relocate and live, but some species will.

                  <h3>Poverty and displacement:</h3>
				<p>The variables that cause and maintain poverty are exacerbated by climate change. Floods could damage people's homes and means of subsistence by sweeping away urban slums. Working outdoors can be challenging in the heat. Crops may suffer from a water shortage. A projected 23.1 million individuals were displaced annually due to weather-related catastrophes over the past ten years (2010-2019), making many more people vulnerable to poverty. Most refugees originate from nations that are least capable of coping with the effects of climate change and are therefore most at risk.</p>

                  <h3>Famine:</h3>
				<p>Global hunger and poor nutrition are on the rise for a variety of reasons, including climate change and an increase in extreme weather occurrences. Crops, animals, and fisheries might all be lost or become less effective. Marine resources that provide food for billions of people are at danger as a result of the ocean's increasing acidity. Food sources from herding, hunting, and fishing have been hampered in several Arctic regions due to changes in the snow and ice cover. Heat stress can reduce available water and grazing areas, which can lower crop output and have an impact on cattle.</p>
